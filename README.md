# python_BphP_MSOT_sim
A forward model to produce time-series photoacoustic images of bacterial phytochromes (BphPs) for my PhD :)

This model uses Python over MATLAB as it is easier to run inside docker containers (necessary to use many HPCs), Python is also open source making the project more easily reproducable.
